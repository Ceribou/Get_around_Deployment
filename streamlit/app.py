### App
st.title("GetAround analysis ðŸš—")

st.markdown("""
    Welcome to  dashboard. Here is the analysis of GetAround data.
    
    When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.

    Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day. Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasnâ€™t returned on time.
    
    The objectives are :
    - Displaying a clear status of the situation ;
    - Understanding causes of late returns ;
    - Proposing recommendations.

According to the analysis, there are issues due to the time delta between two reservations which is sometimes too low. 
Users may wait for the car up to {delay_mean} minutes when the first client checkout delay is higher than the time delta between the two reservations.
This delay seems to be impacted by the checkin type of the first reservation. 2/3 of reservations with delays are preceeded by a reservation with mobile checkout.  

How long the minimum delay should be for the new feature :
- 90 minutes for cars with mobile checkout
- 15 minutes for cars with connect checkout
- This new feature would have reduced by 50% the number of delayed reservations due to late checkouts from previous bookings.

This new feature would decrease the waiting time from 80 minutes to 5 minutes and would decrease the proportion of delayed reservations (from 10 to 5%)
